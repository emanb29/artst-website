## A short-span project
For this project, I aimed to design a squirrel feeder to encourage people to engage more with their local ecosystems. Further, I hoped to knock out several of my design goals for the term as follows:

- Create something that could be scaled to mass-market with little revision
- Create something that gives back to the ecosystem something of what the materials it uses would otherwise have provided
- Use technology in a way that could be applicable to my career in CS
- And, if I'm being honest, I really wanted to see some squirrels

Overall, this project was a resounding success! In order to satisfy the mass-marketability constraint, I designed laser cutter files and ordered a prototype. The plan to maintain ecosystem economics fell through, though, as the orignal plan had been to make the squirrel feeder out of laser-cut wood. However, upon examination of the safety of the materials for the squirrels and other wildlife, I opted to instead use acryllic. And no acryllic trees naturally provide food to squirrels. Oh well.

In practice, this project mostly ended up being an exercise in learning Adobe Illustrator as well as how laser cutting machines work and how to choose and design materials for laser cutting.
