## A short-span project
For this project, I aimed to design a squirrel feeder to encourage people to engage more with their local ecosystems. Further, I hoped to knock out several of my design goals for the term as follows:

### The Goals

- Create something that could be scaled to mass-market with little revision
- Create something that gives back to the ecosystem something of what the materials it uses would otherwise have provided
- Create something that uses a recycled component
- Use technology in a way that could be applicable to my career in CS
- And, if I'm being honest, I really wanted to see some squirrels

### Design Concerns
I had some additonaly constraints and concerns on my design, however:
- The design should be safe for children to assemble
- The feeder should only be accessible to squirrels (since, for example, even birds have somewhat significantly different dietary requirements)
- The feeder must use only non-toxic components, in case any creatures gnaw or injest fragments of the material.

## Retrospective
Overall, this project was a resounding success! In order to satisfy the mass-marketability constraint, I designed laser cutter files and ordered a prototype. The plan to maintain ecosystem economics fell through, though, as the orignal plan had been to make the squirrel feeder out of laser-cut wood. However, upon examination of the safety of the materials for the squirrels and other wildlife, I opted to instead use acryllic. And no acryllic trees naturally provide food to squirrels. Oh well. In any case, the recycled component was maintained: a glass jar is to be attached to the feeder case to hold the food.

In practice, this project mostly ended up being an exercise in learning Adobe Illustrator as well as how laser cutting machines work and how to choose and design materials for laser cutting. I ended up opting to use a service called pokono due to their broad selection of materials and first-cut-is-free policy, allowing me to only pay shipping on my prototype.
