## Motivation
In thinking about and doing research on sustainability, I discovered, espescially in the Portland area, people are exceptionally aware and conscious of sustainability in their personal lives, and try to factor it into their decisions. Where people feel they don't have the power to be more sustainable is at work. I wanted to address this.
### The Problem
Many people, espescially in big cities like Portland or small but relatively urbanized towns like Forest Grove, live within a mile or less of their workplace. Despite this, they tend to commute by car, a very unsustainable practice. One large reason for this is because the nights come so early in Oregon, people can be concerned about visibility to cars as they walk. Also, a lot of energy is wasted while walking in the form of shock. This extra vibration we generate is energy that doesn't serve us, and in fact can, over time, cause physical damage to our bodies.
