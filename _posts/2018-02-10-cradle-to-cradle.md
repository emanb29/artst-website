## Context
After reading _Cradle to Cradle_, by Michael Braungart and William McDonough, I was asked to respond to a sequence of questions and define some terms in the context of _Cradle to Cradle_. What follows are the questions, answers, and definitions.

## Questions
1. What concerns do the authors discuss in relation to the way Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is calculated?

2. Describe the concept contained in the phrase “Less Bad” Why do the authors say that less bad is no good?

3. Write a brief paragraph summarizing the relationships between the following terms, according to the authors: Guardian, Commerce, Design, Regulation, License to harm, Less bad

4. In the section called “Consider the Cherry Tree,” the authors describe 2 different approaches for designing a building; The Eco-efficient building and the Cherry tree building. Make a bullet-point list of the design goals for these 2 approaches:

   - Eco-efficient building:
		- Make the building functional
    	- Produce minimal waste
    	- Produce minimal ecological disruption
    	- Recycle as many materials as possible
   - Eco-effective building:
    	- Make the building functional
        - Use waste products and other outputs of the building as inputs somewhere else (waste = food)
        - Provide the same ecosystem services as the displaced ecological features

5. List a few of the different strategies the authors discuss in the “Respecting Diversity” chapter for how our built and made environment can become more sustainable:

6. In what ways to you respect diversity in your daily life?

7. What are the 5 steps towards eco-effectiveness?

8. What are the 5 guiding principles for eco-effective design?

9. What did you think of this book?

## Definitions

  <dt>Crude Products</dt>
  <dd>A product designed to be the least sufficient response to the greatest targeted problem.</dd>
  <dt>Products Plus</dt>
  <dd>A product that you buy PLUS additional additives or effects you were not aware of and may not want.</dd>
  <dt>Downcycling</dt>
  <dd>Recycling that substantially reduces the quality of the products undergoing it, or else recycling that takes so many resources to perform that the net effect is even less sustainable than simple replacement of the inputs.</dd>
