## Context
After reading _Cradle to Cradle_, by Michael Braungart and William McDonough, I was asked to respond to a sequence of questions and define some terms in the context of _Cradle to Cradle_. What follows are the questions, answers, and definitions.

## Questions
1. What concerns do the authors discuss in relation to the way Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is calculated?

2. Describe the concept contained in the phrase “Less Bad” Why do the authors say that less bad is no good?

3. Write a brief paragraph summarizing the relationships between the following terms, according to the authors: Guardian, Commerce, Design, Regulation, License to harm, Less bad

4. In the section called “Consider the Cherry Tree,” the authors describe 2 different approaches for designing a building; The Eco-efficient building and the Cherry tree building. Make a bullet-point list of the design goals for these 2 approaches:

   - Eco-efficient building:
		- Make the building functional
    	- Produce minimal waste
    	- Produce minimal ecological disruption
    	- Recycle as many materials as possible
   - Eco-effective building:
    	- Make the building functional
        - Use waste products and other outputs of the building as inputs somewhere else (waste = food)
        - Provide the same ecosystem services as the displaced ecological features

5. List a few of the different strategies the authors discuss in the “Respecting Diversity” chapter for how our built and made environment can become more sustainable:

6. In what ways to you respect diversity in your daily life?

7. What are the 5 steps towards eco-effectiveness?

8. What are the 5 guiding principles for eco-effective design?

9. What did you think of this book?

## Definitions
<dl>
  <dt>Crude Products</dt>
  <dd>A product designed to be the least sufficient response to the greatest targeted problem.</dd>
  <dt>Products Plus</dt>
  <dd>A product that you buy PLUS additional additives or effects you were not aware of and may not want.</dd>
  <dt>Downcycling</dt>
  <dd>Recycling that substantially reduces the quality of the products undergoing it, or else recycling that takes so many resources to perform that the net effect is even less sustainable than simple replacement of the inputs.</dd>
  <dt>Eco-effectiveness</dt>
  <dd>Design that uses nature’s principles of reuse to be sustainable.</dd>
  <dt>Technological nutrients</dt>
  <dd>Materials that are usable in products (especially in the context of recycled materials) but not so much as a raw resource.</dd>
  <dt>De-Evolution</dt>
  <dd>I don’t recall this being used in the book, but it means evolution that has a net reduction in complexity / effectiveness (literally, in latin, “rolling down”)</dd>
  <dt>What a “sustainable household” means to me</dt>
  <dd>A sustainable household, in my current rough concept (not yet fleshed out to the degree of writing a whole paper), is a household which is well-informed about key sustainability concepts: downcycling, eco-effectiveness, technical metabolism, etc; and uses this knowledge to inform their choice of products. Additionally, a sustainable household aims to be eco-efficient, using the “Three Rs” where possible, etc. A sustainable household needn’t be perfect, nor should a sustainable household require its constituents to be constantly worried or guilted over sustainability. Currently, too much of the burden falls on the consumer. I think that if households were more informed about sustainability in general, and less apt to immediately go for a “recycled” product despite lower quality, harmful side effects, and other downcycling considerations, enough change would be made in which products get consumed that industry would be forced to make the really effective changes. In other words, the role of the household is to be aware of the issues, be “less bad”, and to urge industry to properly solve those issues.</dd>
