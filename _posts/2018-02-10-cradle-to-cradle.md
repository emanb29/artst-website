## Context
After reading _Cradle to Cradle_, by Michael Braungart and William McDonough, I was asked to respond to a sequence of questions and define some terms in the context of _Cradle to Cradle_. What follows are the questions, answers, and definitions.

## Questions
1. **What concerns do the authors discuss in relation to the way Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is calculated?**

2. **Describe the concept contained in the phrase “Less Bad” Why do the authors say that less bad is no good?**

3. **Write a brief paragraph summarizing the relationships between the following terms, according to the authors: Guardian, Commerce, Design, Regulation, License to harm, Less bad**

4. **In the section called “Consider the Cherry Tree,” the authors describe 2 different approaches for designing a building; The Eco-efficient building and the Cherry tree building. Make a bullet-point list of the design goals for these 2 approaches:**

   - Eco-efficient building:
		- Make the building functional
    	- Produce minimal waste
    	- Produce minimal ecological disruption
    	- Recycle as many materials as possible
   - Eco-effective building:
    	- Make the building functional
        - Use waste products and other outputs of the building as inputs somewhere else (waste = food)
        - Provide the same ecosystem services as the displaced ecological features

5. **List a few of the different strategies the authors discuss in the “Respecting Diversity” chapter for how our built and made environment can become more sustainable:**
	1. Look at local history and culture for locally relevant ways of producing / designing systems / products
	2. Consider how to reduce a product to its simplest form that is still globally relevant, then add local modifications


6. **In what ways to you respect diversity in your daily life?**

	I don’t generally have a need to. I have minimal social interaction with other cultures, and zero professional interaction. Nothing I produce gets consumed by people very different than me. This was a deliberate choice on my part: I write software and do research specifically for people with similar backgrounds and interests so that I can focus on the semantics of my product rather than the presentation. I do acknowledge that this is not always possible, but it is something I have considered.

7. **What are the 5 steps towards eco-effectiveness?**

	1. Eliminate obvious culprits (X substances in industry): consider “Arsenic-free” food. This can often be obvious, but is a necessary first step
	2. Follow well-informed preferences: When designing a product or service, you need to consider the preferences of the consumer of your product/service. However, you can prioritize the values/preferences that are inline with eco-effectiveness, such as respect, ecological intellect, and celebration of natural design
	3. Use passive positivity: ie, substitute non-sustainable options for equivalent sustainable ones when possible, espescially regarding materials. This is the last part of being “less bad”
	4. Redesign to be positive: reframe the problem so that your solution can be truly sustainable, to the extent that the problem allows
	5. Reinvent: find a solution that solves the problem, even if it makes the problem redundant. For instance, I need a safe clothing fabric. Perhaps the reinvented solution is to switch to using leaves instead of processed textiles. This is a little ridiculous, of course, but this step is (insofar as I can tell) usually only productive in producing ridiculous solutions, and is more helpful as an option to keep in the back of your mind, rather than trying to implement each time you design something.


8. **What are the 5 guiding principles for eco-effective design?**

	1. Commit to being eco-effective ("Signal your intention")
    2. b.	Have your designs do more good than harm, ie fix past mistakes (“Restore”)
	3.	Be open to reframing your problem to one better solved by eco-effectiveness (“Be ready to innovate further”)
	4.	Be ready to follow through on sticking with the changes (“Understand and prepare for the learning curve”)
	5.	Act as a steward and, separately, ensure your changes are reversible (or your whole system is replaceable) for when the needs of future consumers change (“Exert intergenerational responsibility”)


9. **What did you think of this book?**

	I think there are definitely multiple authors. Some parts of the book are almost unreadable: the author’s voice is so conceited and willing to try to guilt you into agreeing with him. And yet, other parts seem well-established, relatable, and clearly explained without being patronizing. The intelligence of both (or all) authors shines (again, about half the time in a good way), and the book has some extremely interesting and helpful insights. It has enough examples to be helpful, though it could do with more, as it occasionally gets into overly-abstract philosophy that is difficult to visualize, much less apply without the authors’ backgrounds.

## Definitions
<dl>
  <dt>Crude Products</dt>
  <dd>A product designed to be the least sufficient response to the greatest targeted problem.</dd>
  <dt>Products Plus</dt>
  <dd>A product that you buy PLUS additional additives or effects you were not aware of and may not want.</dd>
  <dt>Downcycling</dt>
  <dd>Recycling that substantially reduces the quality of the products undergoing it, or else recycling that takes so many resources to perform that the net effect is even less sustainable than simple replacement of the inputs.</dd>
  <dt>Eco-effectiveness</dt>
  <dd>Design that uses nature’s principles of reuse to be sustainable.</dd>
  <dt>Technological nutrients</dt>
  <dd>Materials that are usable in products (especially in the context of recycled materials) but not so much as a raw resource.</dd>
  <dt>De-Evolution</dt>
  <dd>I don’t recall this being used in the book, but it means evolution that has a net reduction in complexity / effectiveness (literally, in latin, “rolling down”)</dd>
  <dt>What a “sustainable household” means to me</dt>
  <dd>A sustainable household, in my current rough concept (not yet fleshed out to the degree of writing a whole paper), is a household which is well-informed about key sustainability concepts: downcycling, eco-effectiveness, technical metabolism, etc; and uses this knowledge to inform their choice of products. Additionally, a sustainable household aims to be eco-efficient, using the “Three Rs” where possible, etc. A sustainable household needn’t be perfect, nor should a sustainable household require its constituents to be constantly worried or guilted over sustainability. Currently, too much of the burden falls on the consumer. I think that if households were more informed about sustainability in general, and less apt to immediately go for a “recycled” product despite lower quality, harmful side effects, and other downcycling considerations, enough change would be made in which products get consumed that industry would be forced to make the really effective changes. In other words, the role of the household is to be aware of the issues, be “less bad”, and to urge industry to properly solve those issues.</dd>
