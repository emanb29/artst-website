This was our first charette. It served to introduce us not only to the charette format, but also to the iterative design process and the merits of documenting your progress and thoughts in designing a project.

We originally designed our product around how a child's pinwheel works, considering how little effort is required to make one spin. Further, we assumed that since they can literally be purchased a dime a dozen, the design must be incredibly simple. This strategy paid off, and ultimately our windmill performed exceptionally well.

We based our design specifically off of the app icon for [Pinwheel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmitsoft.pinwheel&hl=en_AU) (found by searching google images for "pinwheel toy") and craft project instructions located at https://www.education.com/activity/article/sunny-pinwheels/
