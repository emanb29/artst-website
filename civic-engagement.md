## Reflection

### Essay Response
_(This portion in response to [https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/enowkin-what-it-means-sustainable-community](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/enowkin-what-it-means-sustainable-community))_

Of the roles Armstrong describes in her essay -- youth, fathers, mothers, and elders -- I definitely align with youths when addressing sustainability, if only out of necessity. The youths are the most concerned with novel and perhaps nontraditional solutions to old problems. Working in the high tech industry as I do, there is very limited traditional knowledge about issues of sustainability and how to address them. Usually it's just "turn off your computer when you're done with it" and "use reusable containers for your coffee". When considering sustainability, these solutions have always seemed irritatingly simple and unimportant to me. That's why for my civic engagement I found a project that presents a novel solution to a sustainability problem -- excessive power consumption in servers -- even though that solution arose as an unexpected side effect of addressing another issue.

### Service applicability to [Principles of Civic Engagement](http://web5.lib.pacificu.edu/gadgets/civic-engagement-principles/)

For the first portion of my service hours, I worked with other students doing the typical CE hours projects. I won't dwell excessively on these, since obviously the school saw them fit for service hours. Instead, I'll focus on my later hours: those working on trying to contribute to mozilla, and sucessfully contributing to docker. Mozilla would have been good as well, perhaps, but due to competition for tasks I gave up on them rather quickly to focus exclusively on Docker.

I believe my work documenting esoteric features of Docker with the Docker project, while perhaps mundane, was strongly applicable to the CE principles. First and foremost, my volunteering was in the **public interest**, as I was contributing documentation for poorly understood features of a widely used server platform.

### Service applicable to personal enrichment
