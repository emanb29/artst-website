## Reflection

### Essay Response
_(This portion in response to [https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/enowkin-what-it-means-sustainable-community](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/enowkin-what-it-means-sustainable-community))_

Of the roles Armstrong describes in her essay -- youth, fathers, mothers, and elders -- I definitely align with youths when addressing sustainability, if only out of necessity. The youths are the most concerned with novel and perhaps nontraditional solutions to old problems. Working in the high tech industry as I do, there is very limited traditional knowledge about issues of sustainability and how to address them. Usually it's just "turn off your computer when you're done with it" and "use reusable containers for your coffee". When considering sustainability, these solutions have always seemed irritatingly simple and unimportant to me. That's why for my civic engagement I found a project that presents a novel solution to a sustainability problem -- excessive power consumption in servers -- even though that solution arose as an unexpected side effect of addressing another issue.

### Service applicability to [Principles of Civic Engagement](http://web5.lib.pacificu.edu/gadgets/civic-engagement-principles/)

For the first portion of my service hours, I worked with other students doing the typical CE hours projects. I won't dwell excessively on these, since obviously the school saw them fit for service hours. Instead, I'll focus on my later hours: those working on trying to contribute to mozilla, and sucessfully contributing to docker. Mozilla would have been good as well, perhaps, but due to competition for tasks I gave up on them rather quickly to focus exclusively on Docker.

I believe my work documenting esoteric features of docker with the Docker Project, while perhaps mundane, was strongly applicable to the CE principles. First and foremost, my volunteering was in the **public interest**, as I was contributing documentation for poorly understood features of a widely used server platform. Secondly, my work was strongly **academically integrated**: most of the documentation I did was for the networking features of docker, and since I will be taking a network class next term, this provided me a great opportunity to get ahead in learning how networking works in real world situations. Thirdly, my work was definitely **reciprocal**: By working on and contributing to the Docker Project, I established some reputation and recognition among people in my industry, and built up my body of work. Penultimately, my work applied **relevant problem-solving** in a novel context (detailed in the following note), following from my research into less-common methods of practicing environmental sustainability in the high tech industy. Lastly, I did of course **reflect on [my] experience**, as you read here.

As a note, since this is not explicitly covered so far as I can tell by the constraints of this reflection, I wanted to emphasize why docker was such a good project to focus on regarding sustainability. Docker provides an alternative approach to server infrastructure for large cloud applications. Where traditionally you might need several always-on [very large, power consuming](https://containerjournal.com/2017/09/06/docker-containers-good-environment/) servers, docker allows dynamic allocation, initialization, and destruction of virtual servers. You only need to use as many resources (and therefore as much power) as necessary for your current workload, rather than continuously having to use the resources you'd require for your maximum workload. Further, since the servers are virtual, you don't need additional hardware manufactured or recycled every time you need to change the scale of your application. This can lead to as much as a 30% drop in infrastructural carbon footprint.

### Service applicability to personal enrichment

As mentioned, the CE hours I spent on open source contributions were incredibly beneficial to my career. In addition to building professional reputation, my CE work helped me learn how to get into doing open source contributions, a staple of respected individuals' practices in my industy. It helped me learn more about docker, a platform I use in my own infrastructures, and it allowed me an opportunity to practice investigating other people's source code in order to learn how it works. Not only that, but investigating thoroughly enough to be able to explain someone else's work to a total stranger.
